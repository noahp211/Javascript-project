# javascript-project: Church Organizer

## Projectâ€™s purpose
The purpose of our website project is to create a welcoming space where users can connect with like-minded individuals, make new friends, and find a place they can call home. It also helps make God more accessible to the broader public by sharing the faith in a way that is easier and more aligned with modern digital experiences. Additionally, the website serves as a way to organize the church's information in a visually appealing and interactive format, helping users stay engaged with the church community. It also provides practical features, such as directions to the church, making it easier for new visitors to find their way. What makes this concept unique and interesting is that you don't often see many church websites incorporating modern features such as array lists, advanced buttons, and dynamic navigation systems.

## Main Features
- Navigation menu for the user to go to different pages our website like about us, find us or donation page.

## Team Members
#### Noah Park
During this project, I created the "Find Us" page, which included setting up an API call to display location details. I also added the initial "Quotes" page, which one of our group members later moved to the homepage for better flow, and I reviewed and approved the change. Additionally, I wrote the About Us paragraph to help introduce visitors to our site. I helped manage the GitHub project board by updating task statuses and reviewing pull requests to keep our workflow organized.

#### Mauricio Trujillo
On our final project, I was responsible for styling some of the home page footer & the whole donations section. This consisted of some CSS, well placed HTML and JS functions to work properly. The JS was done by creating alerts that happen after clicking a button, getting the button data/id and showing a confirmation on screen which later disappears after a few seconds. Finally, it was just pushing the new code into the final project and working together to make it all fit and flow smoothly.

#### Lynneth Tigse Pena
My contributions to the project included being in charge of the homepage, where I added a navigation menu and made it functional to allow users to be redirected to different web pages as desired. Within the homepage, I added a background image to the welcome title to make it more visually appealing. Near the bottom, I also included a slideshow that automatically cycles through posters of upcoming church events.
In addition to the homepage, I was responsible for ensuring that all text across the website was properly aligned. I also helped create the "About Us" page, where I added a contact form that displays error messages if the input fields are empty or invalid. Furthermore, I assisted in reviewing and approving pull requests on GitHub and contributed by adding items to the project board.
